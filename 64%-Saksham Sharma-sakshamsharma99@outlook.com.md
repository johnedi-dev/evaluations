| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **4/ 5**      | Covers users, groups, public channels, message delivery, attachments, sessions. However, lacks a clear model for *private 1-1 conversations*—they seem to be represented as channels but not explicitly clarified. No explicit handling of message edits, deletes, or thread semantics.                                                                                                                                                                  |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **3 / 5**        | Tables are mostly normalized. But: (1) `chat_channel_member_messages` appears to represent messages but uses member-level rather than user-level ownership; this is unusual and complicates message identity. (2) Missing explicit `messages` table; messages seem merged into member_messages, leading to confusion and redundant message data. (3) Many boolean flags (`active`, `deleted`) produce soft-deletion inconsistencies without constraints. |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **3 / 5**      | Candidate acknowledges SQL scalability limits and mentions switching to NoSQL for messages. However, schema design does not reflect partitioning, sharding strategy, indexes, or high-throughput patterns expected for chat workloads. Delivery-per-message fan-out table will explode at scale and candidate notes this but provides no structural mitigation beyond “move to NoSQL.”                                                                   |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **4 / 5**        | `message_delivery_stats` includes timestamps for delivered/read states. Decent coverage of temporal events. But storing one row per member per message will become expensive. No modeling of message send time in the message table (because there is no proper message table).                                                                                                                                                                          |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **3 / 5**      | Password stored as `text` with no hashing. No RBAC model. No concept of organization/tenant isolation. Proposal mentions encryption, rate limits, session validation, but lacks concrete DB-layer security structures.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **4 / 5**        | Attachments handled with an `attachments` table + join table `message_attachments`. Good separation from messages. Minor issue: missing MIME type, size metadata, and permissions.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **3 / 5**      | `chat_channel_members` includes `joined_at` and soft deletion flags. Good start. But lacks membership roles (admin/moderator), ban history, or re-join semantics. No audit trail for changes in membership.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **3 / 5**        | Only a boolean `public` and `channelType` enum. Unclear how permissions differ between public, group, or private channels. No access control modeling.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **2 / 5**        | The notes provide reasoning, but **contain strong indicators of AI-assisted text**, including: inconsistent voice, generic structure, vague trade-offs, unexplained assertions, and references to consulting Claude/GPT—explicitly violating the “AI assistance discouraged” rule. Documentation lacks quantitative or architectural depth.                                                                                                              |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **3 / 5**      | Reasoning is partially coherent but suffers from vagueness, missing rationale for key schema choices, and casual tone. Heavy reliance on soft-deletion everywhere. Clear signs of AI-structured writing. No diagrams or architecture in proposal.                                                                                                                                                                                                        |


### Score: 32 / 50 (64% - Fails)

### Weaknesses

  - Missing a proper messages table — the most critical issue. Using chat_channel_member_messages as the core message entity breaks message identity and introduces major duplication and scalability issues.
  - Security handling is inadequately modeled (password in plaintext, no auth model).
  - No clear modeling of private chats vs groups vs public channels.
  - Poorly defined channel permissions.
  - Scalability considerations are acknowledged but not properly implemented in the schema.
  - Overuse of soft-delete flags without relational or architectural justification.

### On AI-Generated Style

  - Documentation shows clear signs of AI assistance: repetitive explanations, generic statements, soft reasoning, lack of technical specificity, and the candidate explicitly states they used GPT/Claude to do load estimation.
