| **Criterion**                                        | **Score (out of 5)** | **Comments**                                                                                                                   |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **4**                | Technically complete, but coverage feels generic/AI-templated rather than based on personal reasoning.                         |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **4**                | Schema is excellent but too-perfect and suspiciously aligned with common AI output. Deduct 1 for lack of personal originality. |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **4**                | Strong concepts (queues, sharding, replicas), but descriptions are textbook-level AI outputs, not personalized insights.       |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **5**                | Temporal modeling is correct and detailed; this part appears technically sound and original enough.                            |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **3**                | Security content is generic and AI-generated in tone; multi-tenancy still missing.                                             |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **4**                | Good model, but again reads like standard AI patterns (S3 + CDs + signed URLs). Deduct for originality.                        |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **4**                | Accurate mechanics but the explanation is AI-like — generic examples, no personal thought process.                             |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **4**                | Correct design, but heuristics look AI-generated rather than intentionally crafted.                                            |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **2**                | Very high likelihood of AI-generated content. Structure, tone, formatting, and depth are not human-typical. Heavy deduction.   |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **3**                | Clear and polished, but too polished — lacks human reasoning patterns; reads like a ChatGPT technical solution.                |

Total Score: 37 / 50 (74% — Average)

### Remarks
- Major issues:
  - The submission passes technically, but loses significant marks for obvious AI authorship and lack of original reasoning.
  - Major issue: extremely high likelihood of AI generation.
  - Structure is too perfect, sections too balanced, phrasing too uniform.
  - Uses typical AI markers: long bullet lists, symmetrical formatting, exhaustive but generic descriptions.
  - No personal examples, no practical trade-offs from experience, no real constraints.
- Other issues:
  - Multi-tenancy not considered.
  - Some security recommendations are generic boilerplate.
