| **Criterion**                                        | **Score (out of 5)** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |

| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **4**                | Covers private/group/public conversations, message delivery/read status, file handling, and user modeling. However, conversation-type logic fully pushed to app layer without DB enforcement slightly weakens coverage for public-channel rules.                                                                  |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **4**                | Relational part is clean, normalized, and follows standard patterns. Cassandra partitioning hinted (conversation_id + created_at), which is correct. Some nullable fields (e.g., `content?`, `file_url?`) need better justification. Password stored as `varchar` without mention of hashing mechanism in schema. |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **5**                | Excellent use of polyglot persistence: Cassandra for messages, KV for status, blob storage for media. Shows clear reasoning for write-heavy workloads. Very strong alignment with industry patterns.                                                                                                              |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **4**                | Message status table supports sent/delivered/read timestamps. However, lacks clear guarantees for ordering, TTL strategy, and potential denormalization for fast reads (although implied via KV).                                                                                                                 |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **4**                | Proposal mentions IAM, MFA, VPC isolation, HTTPS, encryption, WAF, Shield — strong cloud security basics. Password hashing assumed but not modeled.                                                                                                     |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **4**                | Correct separation into object storage with references in messages. Could improve with metadata (size, mime type, uploaded_by, retention policy).                                                                                                                                                                 |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **4**                | `conversation_participants` table models join/leave timestamps. Lacks clarity on role (admin/mod), invite logic, public-channel posting permissions.                                                                                                                                                              |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **3**                | Completely delegated to application logic; DB provides no structural differentiation except via conversation_types. Missing constraints for posting restrictions or subscriber lists.                                                                                                                             |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **4**                | Notes are concise but shallow. Proposal gives generic cloud best practices but lacks architecture diagrams or deeper trade-offs. Both documents feel somewhat high-level and resemble AI-generated content due to tone, structure, and generic phrasing.                                                          |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **4**                | The design is coherent and technically solid. Reasoning is consistent, but documentation lacks depth and originality in some areas. Still professional and well-structured.                                                                                                                                       |
