| Criterion                                            | Score (out of 5) | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **5**            | Covers private/group/public channels, message history, receipts, threading, attachments, blocking, user presence, and status. All core requirements are correctly represented.                                                                               |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **4**            | Schema is clean, normalized, and relationally consistent. Good use of linking tables and constraints. One minor weakness: public channel access semantics and enforcement rely mostly on application layer. No unbounded denormalized fields.                |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **5**            | Strong scalability strategy: partitioning, replicas, Redis caching, message queues, FIFO ordering, batch inserts. Notes.md covers realistic database bottlenecks and mitigation. Proposal.md demonstrates excellent architecture alignment with scale.       |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **5**            | Message receipts include status timeline + history JSON; messages track updates/deletes; participants track joined/left; presence tracked. Good temporal modeling.                                                                                           |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **4**            | Password hashing and permission validation mentioned. However, proposal.md lacks explicit security practices (RBAC, encryption, tenant isolation). Public channels rely on app-layer logic. Multi-tenant considerations not explicitly modeled or discussed. |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **4**            | Attachments table solid: type, size, CDN URL, thumbnail. Stored externally. Missing upload lifecycle, virus scanning, quotas. Still overall strong.                                                                                                          |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **4**            | channel_participant contains role, status, joined_at, left_at, and mute state. Good structure. Missing deeper audit trail (invites, kicks, bans history).                                                                                                    |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **3**            | Channels have a `type` field (direct/group/public). Public channels are readable by all but this is enforced in application only; not clearly modeled in DB. No explicit subscription semantics.                                                             |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **4**            | notes.md is clear, structured, and detailed. proposal.md has coherent architecture reasoning. However, some areas sound formulaic and similar to AWS serverless boilerplate patterns, reducing originality slightly.                                         |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **5**            | Very well-structured, thoughtful design. Shows understanding of trade-offs, indexing, performance, and large-scale messaging workflows. Clean, professional exposition.                                                                                      |
