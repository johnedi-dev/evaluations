| Criterion                                            | Score (out of 5) | Comments                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | ---------------: | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          |            **5** | Covers private/group/public conversations, message delivery/read status, user model, and file handling. Assumptions for visibility (joined_at) and public channel behavior are stated.                                          |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          |            **4** | Clean, normalized schema (users, conversations, members, messages, receipts). Use of separate status tables is correct. A few model details (e.g., explicit role field on members, richer attachment entity) could be stronger. |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     |            **5** | Thoughtful scalability mitigations: partitioning, read replicas, caching, batching, and clear acknowledgement of write-heavy hotspots.                                                                                          |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      |            **5** | Good temporal modeling: joined_at/exited_at, message timestamps, separate delivery/read status with history potential—supports visibility rules and auditing.                                                                   |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      |            **4** | Strong security recommendations (JWT, TLS, at-rest encryption, password hashing, rate limits). Multi-tenancy/isolation considerations are not explicitly modeled.                                                               |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   |            **4** | Files are supported (file_url, file_type) but there is no dedicated attachments lifecycle table (scanning, dedupe, retention) in the schema—functional but minimal.                                                             |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          |            **4** | conversation_members has joined_at and exited_at and supports hiding prior messages; role/status semantics described. Missing deeper audit/events (invites, role changes, bans) for full history.                               |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     |            **3** | Public channels are recognized and read/write rules are described, but enforcement is left to application logic and subscription/discovery semantics aren’t modeled in DB.                                                      |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        |            **4** | Clear, well-structured, and pragmatic. Covers trade-offs and mitigation strategies. Some sections are concise boilerplate (cloud patterns) rather than unique design insight.                                                   |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** |            **5** | Very professional: coherent assumptions, justified decisions, and practical mitigation strategies. Good balance between detail and overview.                                                                                    |
