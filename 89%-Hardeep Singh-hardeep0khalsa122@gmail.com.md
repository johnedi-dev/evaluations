| **Criterion**                                        | **Score (out of 5)** | **Comments**                                                                                                                                                                               |
| ---------------------------------------------------- | -------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          | **4.5**                | Covers all main features: private, group, and public conversations, message delivery/read tracking, and file sharing. Public read-only rules and join-history visibility could be clearer. |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          | **5**                | Clean, normalized schema with strong relational integrity and proper use of keys and foreign relations. Well above average in correctness.                                                 |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     | **4**                | Mentions indexing and caching but lacks concrete strategies (e.g., partitioning, query optimization). Solid understanding, though not deeply detailed.                                     |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      | **4**                | Implements delivery and read status with timestamps, but lacks message edit/delete tracking and full temporal history. Meets requirement but not exhaustive.                               |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      | **5**                | Excellent coverage — strong focus on encryption, hashing, RBAC, and secure access control. Clearly understood and well-articulated.                                                        |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   | **4**                | Supports file attachments with metadata and links, but no media-specific optimization (e.g., thumbnails or MIME-type handling). Adequate for MVP.                                          |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          | **4**                | Includes join timestamps and user roles, but doesn’t record leave/kick events. Meets essentials but not fully detailed.                                                                    |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     | **4**                | Differentiates conversation types but doesn’t fully define permission enforcement for public channels. Sufficient but incomplete.                                                          |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        | **5**                | Clear, logical, and well-structured. Includes decisions, trade-offs, and limitations. Appears authentic and human-written.                                                                 |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** | **5**                | Highly professional tone, realistic architectural thinking, and strong presentation quality.                                                                                               |

## Total Score: 44.5 / 50 ( 89% —  Pass)

## Remarks

### Strengths:

  Solid, normalized schema with clear entity relationships and scalability awareness.

  Excellent documentation quality, with credible explanations and strong reasoning.

  Secure and professional architectural approach in the proposal.

#### Weaknesses:

  Missing finer temporal tracking (message edit/delete, group leave events).

  Public channel permissions and scalability strategies could be more specific.
