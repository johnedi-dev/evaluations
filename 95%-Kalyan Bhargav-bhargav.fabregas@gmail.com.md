| **1. Requirement Coverage**                          |       **5**      | All core requirements are covered: private, group, and public conversations; per-user message delivery/read status; attachments; and proper user modeling. Public channel behavior is explicitly described in notes.                        |
| **2. Modeling Correctness & Normalization**          |      **4.5**     | Schema is clean, well-normalized, and logically structured. Proper separation of messages, statuses, attachments, and membership. Minor gap: conversation `type` is free-form varchar rather than constrained enum/table.                   |
| **3. Scalability & Performance**                     |      **4.5**     | Strong understanding of scaling issues: indexing, partitioning, sharding by conversation, replicas, caching, cold storage. Realistic trade-offs are discussed rather than hand-wavy claims.                                                 |
| **4. Status & Temporal Events**                      |       **5**      | Excellent handling of temporal aspects: per-user message status, clear status transitions, `joined_at` / `left_at` semantics, and correct filtering logic. This is production-grade.                                                        |
| **5. Security & Multi-Tenancy**                      |       **4**      | Security considerations are solid (hashing, JWTs, TLS, RBAC). Multi-tenancy is implicitly handled via conversation membership but not explicitly discussed as a tenant isolation concept.                                                   |
| **6. Files / Multimedia Handling**                   |      **4.5**     | Attachments are modeled correctly and decoupled from messages. Metadata handling and lazy loading are well-justified. Could further discuss storage lifecycle (retention, cleanup).                                                         |
| **7. Group Membership Semantics & History**          |       **5**      | `conversation_member` with `joined_at` and `left_at` is correctly modeled and clearly reasoned. Historical visibility rules are explicitly enforced and explained.                                                                          |
| **8. Public Channels Semantics**                     |      **4.5**     | Public read / member-write behavior is clearly described in notes. Slightly under-modeled in schema (no explicit “public read without membership” mechanism), but acceptable at design level.                                               |
| **9. Documentation (notes.md & proposal.md)**        |       **4**      | Documentation is thorough, structured, and mostly well-reasoned. However, parts of the proposal (monitoring, queues, retries) are generic and resemble standard architecture templates, suggesting some AI assistance or boilerplate reuse. |
| **10. Overall Clarity, Reasoning & Professionalism** |      **4.5**     | Very clear explanations, consistent terminology, and professional tone. Trade-offs are acknowledged. Reads like a strong mid-to-senior backend engineer submission.                                                                         |
